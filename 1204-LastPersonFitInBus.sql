    Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated 
    such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit. The result format is in the following example.

    Example 1:
    Input: 
    Queue table:
    +-----------+-------------+--------+------+
    | person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
    +-----------+-------------+--------+------+
    | 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
    | 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
    | 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
    | 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
    | 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
    | 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
    +-----------+-------------+--------+------+
    Output: 
    +-------------+
    | person_name |
    +-------------+
    | John Cena   |
    +-------------+
    Explanation: The folowing table is ordered by the turn for simplicity.
    +------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
    | Turn | ID | Name      | Weight | Total Weight |
    +------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
    | 1    | 5  | Alice     | 250    | 250          |
    | 2    | 3  | Alex      | 350    | 600          |
